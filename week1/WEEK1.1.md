## Lecture 1

## 一.What is RFID?

#### **Definition**: 

- RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a technology that uses radio waves to  transfer energy and data between a **reader** and a **movable item** to identify,  categorize, track, …

- The item can be an object, a person, an animal, etc. 

- RFID is fast, reliable, and does not require physical sight or contact between  reader/scanner and the tag.

- RFID, dates back to the invention of RADAR, where, during the Second  World War, fighter pilots cleverly maneuvered their planes to be remotely  identified by friendly radar operators, who distinguished them from their foes (Identify Friend or Foe).

  

  

## 二.What Makes an RFID System?

#### **1.RFID Tag**:

- **Microchip**: Stores data (e.g., unique identifier).
- **Antenna**: Allows for communication with the reader.
- **Passive Tags: No battery, rely on energy from the reader. **
- **Active Tags: Contain a battery and can transmit signals over a longer range.**

#### **2.RFID Reader (Interrogator):**

- **Roles**: Transmit and receive signals between the reader and the tag. 
- **Reader Types:** **Fixed**, **handheld**, and **mobile readers**.

#### **3.Antenna:**

- **Role: **Allows the exchange of data between the tag and reader.
- **Types： **Directional, omni-directional, near-field, and far-field antennas.

#### **4.Software (Middleware)**

- **Role: **  Software used to process data between the RFID system and enterprise  applications.

## 三.How Does RFID Work?

#### **1.Basic Workflow:**

- **Reader:** The RFID reader sends a radio signal to the tag, which powers it and  causes the tag to respond with its stored data.
- **Tag: **The tag, powered by the reader's signal (for passive tags), emits a unique ID  or data when it comes into range.
- **Communication:** The data is sent back to the reader, which transmits it to the  system for processing.

#### **2.No Line of Sight Needed:**

- Unlike barcodes, RFID does not require a direct line of sight between the reader  and the tag.

#### **3.Multiple Tags:**

- Multiple RFID tags can be read simultaneously, making RFID more efficient for  tracking large quantities of items.

## 四.Automatic Identification Technology

#### **1.Automatic identification:**

- The essence of the recognition technique is to distinguish and identify the physical objects using their identifiable features.

#### **2.Biometric Procedures：**

- **Fingerprinting procedures**
- Voice identification
- Face recognition
- Retina identification
- Heartbeat recognition technology

#### **3.Fingerprint Identification**

- Fingerprint identification uses the uniqueness and stability of fingerprint to verify user identity by comparing the collected
  fingerprints with the pre-sampled fingerprints.
- **Stability：** High accuracy of identification，Low error rate，Each fingerprint has multiple feature points，Each feature point has 5 to 7 features，Ten fingers can produce at least 4900，independent features that can be measured
- **High speed：** Fingerprint match can be completed in 1 to 2 seconds
- **Security issues**： Fingerprints are easy to leave over，Fingerprint replication is getting easier

#### **4.Speech Recognition：**

- Speech recognition uses **the difference** between **each person's tone** and **timbre** to identify different people.

#### **5.Face Recognition：**

- Face recognition is based on human face features. It performs identity authentication by analyzing the input face
  image.

  instrument and then identify the inherent characteristics of each person heartbeat.

## 五.Bar Codes

- The barcode is a **binary code** comprising a field of bars and gaps arranged in a **parallel configuration**

#### **1.1D Barcode Recognition:**

- 1D barcode is a **combination of lines and blanks** in accordance with certain coding rules to **represent certain information.**
- 1D barcode **only express information in the horizontal direction**, and **in the vertical direction does not express any information**. It usually **retains a certain height** to facilitate the alignment of the reader.

  rain
- **More security:** you can encrypt RFID tags so only your reader can get the data

##### ***Reflection signal strength is affected by the distance and other factors significantly***

- Since the RFID tag itself is **a passive device**, the feedback signal **must be modulated by backscatter**. Therefore, the strength of the RFID tag reflection signal is susceptible to the surrounding environment, **including distance, reader power, signal interference,and tag deployment density**

##### ***Low cost, can be deployed at a large scale:***

- RFID tags tend to **large-scale mass production using printed circuits**, so manufacturing costs can be significantly reduced.
  At present, the cost of an RFID tag can be controlled at **around 10 cents**.
